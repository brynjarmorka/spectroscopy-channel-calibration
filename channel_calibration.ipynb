    "# Goal of this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a spectrum with known peaks to calibrate the channels of a detector,\n",
    "and then use the calibration to plot an unknown spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calibrate a spectrum we calculate:\n",
    "  - dispersion [keV / channel], which is the width of each channel\n",
    "  - offset [channels], which is the distance from first data entry to keV=0\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have calibrated a spectrum, we could also find:\n",

    "  - quantities of each element, \n",

    "\n",
    "### What we will do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in the data of a known spectrum\n",
    "2. Fit the data to a gaussian\n",
    "3. Calibrate the x-axis\n",
    "4. Plot the calibrated data\n",
    "5. Use the calibrated x-axis on an unknown spectrum from the same source\n",
